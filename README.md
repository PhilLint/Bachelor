Solutions and implementation from [Philipp Lintl](https://github.com/PhilLint). As most of the courses I took did not entail self reliant work, I focus on subjects towards the end of the Bachelor course. 

## Thesis 

TO BE DONE: A redacted version of my Bachelor Thesis: 'Topic Modeling: An overview of different methods and their application'. It is placed in the field of NLP and focusses on the statistical side of the probabilistic Graphical models that are most prevalent to combat this task. Specifically, I dive into the formulas of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its alterations with regards to the model itself and various inference methods. 

## Advanced Bayesian Statistics

Assignments in the form of RMarkdown files with a focus on Bayesian Inference, especially MCMC.

## R Programming

In the second practical R programming course, we had to fulfil some basic statistical tasks, as well as a at the time very challenging task to create starting positions for Battleship with the input being the number and sizes of the ships to be placed. 

## Functional Data

This was a seminar focused on Functional Data and its future relevance for the application on sensory data. My task was to to present the functional form of Principal Component Analysis with an application on a self chosen Dataset. I chose an airquality Dataset and separated the time series data into day windows.
